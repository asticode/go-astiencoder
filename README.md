`astiencoder` is an open source video encoder written in GO and based on [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) C bindings

Right now this project has only been tested on FFMpeg n4.4.1

You need GO >= 1.13

# Why use this project when I can use `ffmpeg` binary?

In most cases you won't need this project as the `ffmpeg` binary is pretty awesome.

However, this project could be useful to you if you're looking to:

1. understand how the video encoding process work
1. integrate your video encoder in a GO ecosystem
1. visualize in real time, record or replay your encoding workflow and nodes statuses and stats
1. use native GO subtitle libraries like [astisub](https://github.com/asticode/go-astisub)
1. build your own video encoder and take control of its workflow

# How is this project structured?
## The encoder framework

At the root of the project, package `astiencoder` provides the framework to build [Workflows](workflow.go). Workflows are made of [Nodes](node.go). Nodes can start/pause/continue/stop any kind of work.

It also provides a [Server](server.go) that exposes the UI.

All internal [Events](event.go) can be handled with the proper `EventHandler`.

## The libav wrapper

In folder `libav`, package `astilibav` provides the proper nodes to use the `ffmpeg` C bindings with the encoder:

- [Opener](libav/opener.go)
- [Demuxer](libav/demuxer.go)
- [Decoder](libav/decoder.go)
- [Filterer](libav/filterer.go)
- [Encoder](libav/encoder.go)
- [Muxer](libav/muxer.go)
- [PktDumper](libav/pkt_dumper.go)

At this point the way you connect those nodes is up to you since they implement 2 main interfaces:

```go
type PktHandler interface {
	HandlePkt(p *PktHandlerPayload)
}

type FrameHandler interface {
	HandleFrame(p *FrameHandlerPayload)
}
```

## The out-of-the-box encoder

In folder `astiencoder`, package `main` provides an out-of-the-box encoder using both packages `astiencoder` and `astilibav`.

It creates workflows based on [Jobs](astiencoder/job.go).

It's a good place to start digging if you're looking to implement your own workflow builder.

# How do I install this project?
## FFMpeg

In order to use the `ffmpeg` C bindings, you need to install ffmpeg. To do so, run the following command:

```
$ make install-ffmpeg
```

In some cases, you'll need to enable/disable libs explicitly. To do so, use the `configure` placeholder. For instance this will install the `libx264` as well:

```
$ make install-ffmpeg configure="--enable-libx264 --enable-gpl"
```

## Astiencoder

Simply run the following command:

```
$ go get github.com/asticode/go-astiencoder/...
```

# How can I run the out-of-the-box encoder?
## Modes

The out-of-the-box encoder has 2 modes:

- by default it will spawn the server and wait for a new workflow to be added manually
- when provided with the `-j` flag, it will open the provided json-formatted job, transform it into a workflow, execute it and exit once everything is done

To run the default mode, simply run the following command:

```
$ make server
```

## Web UI

If you set up the server correctly, you can open the Web UI in order to see your node's stats.

### What do those stats mean?

Nodes use the same stats:

- Incoming rate: the number of incoming object received per second. This is either packets per second (`pps`) or frames per second (`fps`).
- Listen ratio: the percentage of time spent waiting for a new incoming object
- Dispatch ratio: the percentage of time spent waiting for all children to be available to process the output object.
- Work ratio: the percentage of time spent doing some actual work

That way you can monitor the efficiency of your workflow and see which node needs work.

# How can I run examples?

Examples are located in the `examples` folder and consists of json-formatted jobs.

If you want to run a specific example, run the following command:

```
$ make example=<name of the example>
```

File outputs will be written in the `examples/tmp` folder.

**WARNING**: for the following examples you will need specific ffmpeg libs enabled. Again, in order to do so, use the `configure` placeholder as mentioned [here](#ffmpeg):

- encode: `--enable-libx264 --enable-gpl`

# How can I build my own workflow?

I'd recommend to get inspiration from the out-of-the-box encoder's [workflow builder](astiencoder/workflow.go).

# Which ffmpeg C bindings is this project using and why?

Right now this project is using [these bindings](https://github.com/asticode/goav).

Here's why:

1) [the base project](https://github.com/giorgisio/goav) is not maintained anymore
2) [this project](https://github.com/targodan/ffgopeg) is a hard fork of #1 but has gone a very different route
3) [this project](https://github.com/selfmodify/goav) is a fork of #1 but I'm experiencing lots of panics
4) [this project](https://github.com/amarburg/goav) is the best fork of #1 even though the last commit is not recent
5) [this project](https://github.com/ioblank/goav) is a fork of #4 with interesting additional commits
6) [this project](https://github.com/koropets/goav) is a fork of #4 with interesting additional commits
7) [this project](https://github.com/alon-ne/goav) has a very nice set of examples

Therefore I've forked #4, added useful commits from other forks and removed deprecated functions so that it works properly in FFMpeg n4.4.1.

# I'm not familiar with CGO, which flags am I supposed to provide?

If you're using `make`, you're not supposed to add CGO flags manually, it will do it for you.

Otherwise you need to provide the proper `CGO_CFLAGS`, `CGO_LDFLAGS` and `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variables when running your GO code.

Let say the absolute path to your current dir is `/path/to`, here are their respective values:

- `CGO_CFLAGS`: -I/path/to/vendor_c/include
- `CGO_LDFLAGS`: -L/path/to/vendor_c/lib
- `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`: /path/to/vendor_c/lib/pkgconfig
